JAutosub is an Windows app that can be used to generate <b>automatic transcription / automatic subtitles </b> for audio/video files  through a friendly graphical user interface. For the hard work of speech recognition it is made use of the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/speech/">Google Speech Recognition API</a>.
<br>
<br>
This app is basically a friendly Java GUI for a pre-packaged, ready to use, Windows version of <a href="https://github.com/agermanidis/autosub">Autosub 0.3.12</a>. All the hard work of processing the audio is done by Autosub.
<br>
<br>
The app by default outputs the subtitles as .srt and the transcribed audio on the user interface as well  as .txt files.
Internet connection is REQUIRED because it uses the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/speech/">Google Cloud Speech Server</a> for the job, in the same way as the <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6373554?hl=en">Youtube Automatic Subtitles</a>. 
<br>
IMPORTANT: The <b>accuracy</b> of the result can vary a lot, depending on many factors, mainly the <b>quality/clarity</b> of the audio. Ideally the audio input should not have background noise, sound effects or music. If there is a single speaker and he speaks in a clear and slow speed seems that the recognition is much more accurate. Sometimes, under ideal conditions it is possible to get a <a href="https://medium.com/@mlockrey/youtube-s-incredible-95-accuracy-rate-on-auto-generated-captions-b059924765d5">accuracy result close to 95%</a>.
